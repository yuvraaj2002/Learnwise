Learnwise allows users to input text or keywords related to their research interests. The application then intelligently scrapes the web to find corresponding scientific papers and loads them into a dynamic RAG system. This system enables users to engage in interactive, insightful conversations about the content, making complex information more accessible and easier to understand.

Whether you're delving into new research, seeking to deepen your understanding of a specific topic, or simply exploring academic literature, Learnwise is here to enhance your learning experience with cutting-edge technology.
